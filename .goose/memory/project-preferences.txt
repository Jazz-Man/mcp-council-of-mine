# Project-Specific: Biome Formatting Rule

## Rule:
**ALWAYS run `biome check --write src/` after making changes to TypeScript files in this project.**

## When to run:
- After editing/creating .ts files
- Before committing changes
- After batch edits

## Commands:
- `biome check --write src/` - Full check + format + fix
- `biome format --write src/` - Format only
- `biome lint --write src/` - Lint + fix only

## Why:
Project uses Biome for code formatting and linting. Must be run after every TypeScript file change to maintain consistent code style.
